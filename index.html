                <p class="custom-font-size">
                    This project aims to build and employ price prediction algorithms for cryptocurrency. At the onset, we understand the volatility of such prices and the range of unpredictable factors that influence the prices of crypto, which is why the predictions that we are generating here are quite short. We are using a Keras LSTM (long-short-term-memory) model with TensorFlow to analyze and predict pricing on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. For each currency, the historical Adjusted Close data was used to build into 7 and 30 Day time sequences, which were fed into the model. The data is scaled logarithmically before processing and then reverse scaled for graphing predictions. We tried several optimizations for each model and saved the best performing model for each currency. We are using this model to predict the future price of each currency. All Crypto data is being pulled from CoinApi through Python.                </p>

                    Below is the 7 day prediction for each currency along with several other performance metrics. Following that is a scaled comparison against the NASDAQ and individual breakdowns of price, prediction and testing performance.

            <p class="custom-font-size">
                Below is a plot which shows the price movement of the 3 currencies over time. Each currency had to be scaled between 0 and 1 in order to put them all on the same plane since their individual values differ greatly. The point of this plot is not to show that one currency is better than another, but it shows their relative value over time and also makes it clear that they largely follow the same path in value. The plot also includes the scaled performance of the NASDAQ (taken from the Yahoo Finance API) so that one can see the correlation or divergence between the index and currency values.

                Three LSTM models were constructed, the first with the full range of dates, the second and third beginning in 2018, when the price saw a first major increase. In this case, we experimented with using a Bidirectional LSTM, which yielded very high scores for the first model but poorer results for the reduced dataset. As a result, we only used the Bidirectional method for the first model, which we chose for prediction. The first 2 models use a 7 day lookback window for input with 1 LSTM layer and 2 hidden layers. The third model uses 2 LSTM layers and 1 hidden layer. An R2 Score of .92 was achieved with the second model.

                Ethereum trained better using a 7 day lookback window. As with Bitcoin, the initial dataset was reduced to focus on the recent 50% of dates for the second two models. The R2 Score was .90 using the third model, which was trained for 300 epochs.

                Litecoin used 30 Day Lookback LSTM models with a max R2 Score of .92 using the first model with a learning rate of .0001, trained for 300 epochs. It may be possible to achieve a higher R2 Score with increased epochs of training or a slower learning rate but it is not immediately clear if this will have the effect of greater accuracy in future prediction given the extent that all outside factors have on value change in currencies.             </p>

            It will take some additional observation and testing to assess the accuracy of the models developed for each currency. Since there are no obvious patterns present in currency price data (as there may be in annual temperature data or any trend with a seasonal pattern), it will be difficult to predict very far ahead. Ideally, these models will be tuned to predict movement more precisely but with this initial deployment, they are at least showing the power of LSTM to learn and train on past patterns.
